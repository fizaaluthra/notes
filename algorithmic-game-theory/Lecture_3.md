# Recap

Why is Vickery Auction awesome?
- auction is very easy to play - obvious choice is to play dominant strategy (as opposed to first-price auction)
- from the designer perspective - assuming that the players play their dominant strategies (which is the weakest behavioural assumption), highest bidder will win - so it maximises social surplus (the good is given to the bidder who values it the highest) 
- the social surplus optimization problem is one that you might have wanted to solve -- but you didnt have the data because you didnt know the players valuations (only the players know their valuations). however, through this auction you were able to solve it.
- runs in polynomial time
